        question: "Q:  How do I enter and capitalize in the Crypto market?",
        answer: "Blockchain allows three things that might be useful for businesses. First, thanks to smart contracts, it can automate every single process that doesn’t require creativity. Second, it allows the storing of sensitive information in such a manner that any piece cannot be modified or deleted by any employee. Third, some organizations accept cryptocurrencies as payment for their services and/or use cryptocurrencies to transfer value from one city to another and/or pay salaries with cryptocurrencies (contact your local tax advisor before doing this)."

        question: "Q: How do I stay relevant and avoid being made absolencent by the implementation of Blockchain systems?",
        answer: "Actually, none of the three applications described above apply specifically to financial services companies – they can be applied to a number of companies in different sectors. In no way is it true that the blockchain can bring more value to financial organizations than to other ones. That said, I have to admit that major companies are still at the phase of testing blockchain technology. Smart contracts are clearly the most promising direction. Smart contract-based deals are already being seen in trade finance: e.g. Barclays trade finance deal and Texas → Qingdao cotton deal. I love the concept of the latter one: GPS trackers were placed inside of 88 bales of cotton, and when the transmitted coordinates coincided with the coordinates of the addressee warehouse in Qingdao, a smart contract automatically sent locked funds to the carrier. This can change the logistics industry entirely. I also like the concept of Confideal, who are working on a GUI tool for constructing smart contracts without coding, and Acronis Notary, who facilitates the permanent storing of imprints on any documents."

        question: "Q: How will Blockchain impact my day to day life?",
        answer: "For the first time, such construction as blockchain appeared in Bitcoin; the first description of Bitcoin is dated on October 2008. Thus, the construction is not new. In terms of computer science, blockchain has been around for 2 decades as a linked list — a simple data structure, which secures the integrity of multi-party development branches (with the instrument called git). But, we must take a bow to the Bitcoin creator, as he was the first to apply the concept of proof-of-work to linked lists, which made securing sensitive data, such as financial transaction history, doable. It’s important to understand that blockchain is essentially a distributed ledger with one innovative property — immutability of data that is written to it (that means, inability to change or delete that data). This can be used for storing financial transactions, which was the first case. However, many other use cases arose with time. For example, Namecoin (April 2011) was the first alternative usage of the blockchain — besides storing transaction history of its internal currency, it also allowed to buy a domain name in «.bit»-zone. After Namecoin, dozens of other alternative cryptocurrencies («altcoins») appeared. However, the true might of blockchain was unleashed with Ethereum inception, in November 2013. Ethereum (started in July 2015) allowed for smart contracts, making digital money programmable."

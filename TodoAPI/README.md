### How to Start

First clone the repo 

`$ git clone https://github.com/Nickadiemus/TodoAPI.gitmonospace`, 

Then cd into the repo and install the node dependencies for the Server

`$ npm install`

Then cd into 

`$ cd client_source/` and install npm dependencies 

After that we can now start the server by going to the parent directory

`$ cd ../`

and then running

`$ npm run start:dev`

This will run the server on *//localhost:3000* and connect to the postgresql database

now we can run the client by cding into the client_source

`$ cd client_source/` and running `$ npm start`
